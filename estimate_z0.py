# script to quickly estimate the roughness length of a point using the rule of thumb, and a cropped bdsm.
# This estimate is to be used in the wx_stability script, aiming to extract params needed to run footprint calcualtion
# from wx data files (rather than relying on eddy covariance).
# roughness length is used within the calculation of ustar and L.
