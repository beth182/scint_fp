# raster_R_scripts

These files create land cover information files using R.

- The output files are rasters of building, vegetation and terrain height (BDSM, CDSM, DSM)
- The output files are used within the source area model software (scintools)
- The scripts have been written for the purpose of changing the existing rasters to courser resolution (e.g. 1 m to 4 m resolution)
